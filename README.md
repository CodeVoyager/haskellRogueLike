# Haskell roguelike

This is the code for the [Haskell roguelike blog post](http://www.andrevdm.com/posts/2018-04-02-haskell-rogue-like.html)

There are 20 sub-projects each corresponding to one of the blog sub-posts/chapters. The code has the annotations for my [Hakyl include compiler](http://www.andrevdm.com/posts/2018-02-05-hakyll-code-build-include-compiler.html). The source.zip archive has the source without the annotations, this is created/updated when the makefile or `mkDiff.sh` is run.
